# Digital_Analog_Conversion
Piano tones

The objective of this lab is to learn about digital to analog conversion. 
The sub objective of this lab is to understand how digital data stored in a computer could be used to represent sounds and music.  

 I am using notes C,F,A for the sound notes in the lab.  
 The  musical  Notes  can  be  calculated  by note and their respecting frequency. 
 We have clock of 3 MHz and frequency of note C is 523 so 3000000/523, we get 5736.13766 SysTick counts, 
 since each cycle is consists of 32 values so we have divide SysTick count 5736.13766 by 32 to get 179 SysTick count.
